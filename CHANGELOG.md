# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Entries describe changes from the perspective of someone installing or using
pi-tgrep — what changed for them, not how it was implemented internally.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Searches no longer spawn `tgrep status` before every query. The indexing verdict is memoized for
  the session (a build in progress is re-checked every few seconds), which takes roughly a third
  off the latency of each `grep` tool call where spawning a process is the dominant cost.

### Added

- `PI_TGREP_BIN` sets the tgrep executable to use, for installs the `PATH` search cannot resolve
  (a renamed release binary, a download outside `PATH`). The value is probed with `tgrep --version`;
  one that does not run leaves the extension dormant rather than silently using another binary.

### Fixed

- Windows: tgrep is discovered with `where.exe` and every candidate is probed before use, so a
  listing Node cannot spawn (Git Bash drive paths such as `/c/Users/...`, the `.exe` suffix Git Bash
  strips, `.cmd`/`.bat` shims) no longer sends every search to the ripgrep fallback.
- Windows: starting the server no longer crashes the host when the binary cannot be spawned; the
  failure is reported in the session instead, and the readiness wait stops instead of polling for
  ten seconds.
- Windows: `/tgrep-stop` verifies the recorded pid with `tasklist` instead of the Git Bash `ps`,
  which rejects `-o`. It now stops the daemon instead of reporting "no server running" and leaving
  the server running untracked.
- Windows: a missing binary no longer offers a `brew install` that cannot work; it explains where to
  get tgrep instead, once.
- A daemon that fails to start is surfaced as a warning instead of leaving the footer at
  "tgrep: no index".
- No console window flashes for searches or for the spawned server on Windows.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- A `grep` after a shell keyword on the same line (`do grep …`, `then grep …`, `else grep …`,
  `if grep -q …; then`, `while grep …`, `! grep …`, `{ grep …`) is now translated like any other,
  instead of running unchanged. A grep in a condition with a flag tgrep can't translate
  (`if grep -qz …`) is now blocked, as it is on its own line. Grep inside a `case` arm or a
  `( … )` subshell still runs unchanged.
- A `cd` under `if` / `then` / `do` is treated as an unknown directory for the commands after it,
  since it may run conditionally or repeatedly.
- A `grep` on its own line in a multi-line `bash` command or `ctx_execute` / `ctx_execute_file`
  shell script is now translated like any other, including after a heredoc, instead of running
  unchanged (or, after a heredoc in a script, being blocked). `# comments` are ignored.
- Each `grep` in a script uses the index of the directory it runs in, following `cd` lines. After
  a `cd` whose target can't be resolved (`cd "$DIR"`, `cd ~/x`), later greps run unchanged until
  an absolute `cd`.
- A rewritten command keeps your original spacing around `;`, `&&`, `||` and `|` (for example
  `a; grep …` becomes `a; tgrep search …`, not `a ; tgrep search …`).
- A stdin redirect (`<`) or `&` backgrounding now blocks only the grep it applies to, not every
  other command in the same script.
- A grep inside a multi-line `$( … )` in a `ctx_execute` / `ctx_execute_file` script is now
  blocked, as it already was in `bash`; before, the script scan translated it line by line.

### Fixed

- A `>` inside a trailing `# comment` after a grep (`grep foo src # a > b`) is no longer treated
  as a redirect, which made the rewrite create or truncate a file.
- A shell string like `$'it\'s'` elsewhere in a script no longer makes the whole script fail with
  "quoting couldn't be parsed"; only a grep with unparseable quoting is blocked.
- A quoted environment prefix (`FOO='a b' grep …`) keeps its quotes in the rewritten command
  instead of becoming `FOO=a b tgrep …`.
- A `cd` that feeds a pipe or runs in the background no longer changes the directory used to find
  the index for later commands.
- A grep that reads a here-string (`grep foo <<< "x"`) runs unchanged instead of being mistranslated.
- A backslash-newline line continuation in a grep command is no longer passed to `tgrep` as a
  literal argument.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Shell commands that contain a heredoc (`cat > f <<'EOF' … EOF`) next to a `grep` are no longer
  rejected. The heredoc body was scanned as shell, so a `<` (for example XML) was reported as
  "Input redirected via <" and an apostrophe as "quoting couldn't be parsed". Heredoc bodies are
  now left untouched, and here-strings (`<<<`) are allowed.
- `ctx_execute` / `ctx_execute_file` shell code that contains a heredoc no longer blocks a
  `cmd | grep x` pipe (with a misleading `PI_TGREP_BASH_POLICY=block` message), and a here-string
  (`<<<`) is no longer mistaken for a heredoc that hid the grep lines after it from translation.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- Shell `grep` patterns with an unescaped `| ( ) { } + ?` (literal in basic regex, but a regex
  operator in tgrep's engine) are no longer silently mistranslated, which could match far more
  than the original pattern or fail with a regex parse error. These now run as plain `grep`
  unchanged.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- A translated shell grep with an empty pattern (`grep -c "" file`, often used to count lines)
  no longer loses the pattern. Before, the file name became the pattern and the command printed
  nothing.
- Unquoted globs, `~` and brace expansions in translated shell greps (`grep -n foo src/*.ts`)
  expand again. Before, they reached tgrep as literal text and failed with an IO error.
- Shell greps over a variable or command substitution (`grep -n foo "$f"`, `grep -rn "$PAT" src`)
  no longer search for the literal text `$f`/`$PAT`. They now run unchanged.
- JavaScript run through `ctx_execute` is no longer blocked just for calling `RegExp.exec` (or any
  other `.exec`/`.spawn` method that isn't `child_process`). Unextractable `child_process` calls
  are now only blocked when the code mentions grep at all.

### Changed

- When a translated shell grep fails or prints nothing, the tool result now shows which
  `tgrep search` command ran in place of the original, so the model can tell a real empty
  result from a translation problem instead of assuming grep is blocked.
- Shell greps over `$(…)`, backtick or `$var` file lists, and commands behind a dynamic
  `cd "$DIR" && …`, now run unchanged instead of being blocked. A grep nested inside `$(…)`
  or backticks is still blocked.
- `a || grep …` is split and translated like `&&` instead of being blocked.
- Block messages now say what triggered them (for example command substitution, stdin
  redirect, or the specific unsupported flag) and mention that piping into grep runs unchanged.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Shell `grep`/`rg` commands are now translated to `tgrep search` instead of the bare default
  query mode, which could hang indefinitely and spawn an orphaned server when no tgrep server
  was running for the searched directory.
- A translated command now uses the index of the directory it actually runs in (the leading
  `cd` target when present), so `cd /other/repo && grep …` searches that repo's index rather
  than the session repo's.
- When the searched directory has no index yet (for example during the initial index
  build), the translated `tgrep search` scans the files directly instead of rebuilding an
  index beside the searched path, so the very first search of a session still works.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Compound shell commands joined with `&&` or `;` that contain a `grep`/`rg` call no longer
  block the entire command. Only the search part is rewritten to use the tgrep index and the
  rest of the command runs unchanged. The whole command is still blocked when its search part
  cannot be translated, or when it uses command substitution, backticks, background `&`, or
  input redirection.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Shell `grep`/`rg` commands that use backslash escapes (for example `\b`, `\d`, `\.`) are
  rewritten to `tgrep` with the pattern preserved, instead of being corrupted into a pattern
  that matched nothing.
- The message shown when a shell search is blocked now points at the index-backed `grep` tool
  and tells you to pass `--index-path` when running `tgrep` yourself, instead of suggesting a
  bare `tgrep` run that only looks for the index next to the searched path.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- npm installs now carry only what runs: the extension, its sources, README, changelog, and
  license. Test fixtures and CI workflow files are no longer downloaded with the package.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Auto-indexing of the enclosing git repo via a shared, file-watching `tgrep serve` daemon.
- A `grep` tool that transparently routes searches through the trigram index, with fallback
  to ripgrep when the index isn't ready yet.
- A shell policy hook that translates `grep`/`rg` shell commands (including inside pipelines)
  to `tgrep`, with `translate` / `block` / `warn` / `off` modes via `PI_TGREP_BASH_POLICY`.
- Graceful degradation when the `tgrep` binary is missing, with an optional one-time
  Homebrew install prompt (`PI_TGREP_AUTO_INSTALL`).
